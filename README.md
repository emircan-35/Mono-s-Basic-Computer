# Mono's Basic Computer
Developed Mono's Basic Computer to understand the computer architecture in a practical manner. 

You need to have the Quartus application in your environment to see the computer design. After that you can easily import the quartus project using the rar file named "Quartus_Files" into your local.

If you just would like to see what it is like, you can find some photos from 2 sub-folders named "schemes" and "waveforms".

In case of a need for further information or a contact for any reason, please do not hesitate to reach me via the e-mail below.
